  "description": "The Marshal is unique compared to the Operator for having a extremely fast scoping animation, great no-scope accuracy and a fast movement speed. This can be used to peek quickly and get a shot off very easily. It is a two shot to the body, one to the head and two to the legs against heavy armor.",
