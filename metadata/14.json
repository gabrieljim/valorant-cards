  "name": "Vandal",
  "description": "The Vandal is a fully automatic rifle that sits at 2,900 Credits. It is the counterpart to the Phantom, and is unique for its high DPS at any range. It is incredibly lethal due to its ability to kill opponents with one shot to the head at all ranges. Like other rifles, one can aim down the sights (ADS) to reduce spread at the cost of fire rate.",
