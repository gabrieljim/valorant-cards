  "description": "The Ghost is semi-automatic sidearm pistol. It deals a fairly high amount of damage upon hit, usually taking 2 shots to the head and 5 to 6 shots to the body to kill. The Ghost comes equipped with a silencer, which helps to increase its overall accuracy, and also reduces noise while firing, making it effective as a stealth weapon.",
