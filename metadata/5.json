  "description": "The Bucky is the cheapest primary weapon in the game at 850 credits, making it useful for half-buy rounds. It shoots 15 pellets per shot with high falloff. At 8 or fewer meters, 8 pellets to the body are enough to kill, while 12 pellets are needed at 8-12 m. Any pellets that strike the head deal double damage.",
