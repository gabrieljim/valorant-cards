  "name": "Odin",
  "description": "The Odin is the second most expensive gun in the game, costing 3200 credits. It is a heavy weapon that, like the Ares, is best used for wallbanging due to its high wall penetration and high magazine size, which is the highest in the game at 100. Its primary fire, again like the Ares, speeds up during fire but unlike the Ares, its ADS allows you to immediately start shooting at its maximum fire rate.",
