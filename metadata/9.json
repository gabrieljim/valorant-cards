  "name": "Spectre",
  "description": "The Spectre is a moderately-priced submachine gun that occupies its wielder's primary weapon slot. It is outfitted with a silencer that reduces the range of the weapon's audio profile. In comparison to the Stinger, it is substantially more accurate, kicks considerably less, possesses slightly more cover piercing capability, and has a higher magazine capacity (30 as opposed to 20). However, its slightly lower per-shot damage and lessened fire rate render its total output statistically lower.",
