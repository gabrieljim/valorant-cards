  "name": "Stinger",
  "description": "The Stinger has a low damage per shot compared to nearly every other weapon in the game and furthermore has an absurdly high spread, leading to lower accuracy. However, the Stinger is very cheap and has high damage per second. Its time-to-kill is quick, only outmatched by the Odin, Vandal, Phantom, and instant-kill weapons at close range; but landing shots accurately at medium to long range will prove difficult.",
